# Netlify Redirects

# Ensure admin pages are served directly (although Netlify does this by default for existing files, being explicit helps)
/page/edit.html      /page/edit.html      200
/page/new.html       /page/new.html       200
/page/dashboard.html /page/dashboard.html 200

# Handle dynamic QR code paths (e.g. /page/ferreirajy3tcz) by rewriting to the redirector
/page/*              /page/index.html     200

# Fallback for any other path to the redirector (or you might want root index.html for login)
# If someone types /unknown, they go to redirector?
# Or if they type /dashboard (without page), maybe redirect to login?
# For now, mirroring Firebase config:
/*                   /page/index.html     200
